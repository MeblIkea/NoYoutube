<h2><b>This extension will make you gain time ladies & gentleman</b></h2>
This extension will remvove you the part of the main page of Youtube, where it suggest you random videos and shorts.
Now, you will not be distracted anymore, and just check the notification bell, to see if a new <b>good</b> video is released, that you never <b>seen</b> before.
(It also remove shorts button)

For the moment, it's only on Firefox, because Chrome is just bad for uploading extensions :/
